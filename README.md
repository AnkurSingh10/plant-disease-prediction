# ðŸŒ± Crop Disease Prediction System

**AI-powered plant disease detection with 95.5% accuracy using hybrid deep learning models**

## Overview
Diagnoses diseases in 9 critical crops (**apple, potato, cherry, corn, grape, pepper bell, sugarcane, tomato, strawberry**) by analyzing leaf images. Combines custom CNN architectures with fine-tuned ResNet-50 models for high-precision agricultural diagnostics.

## Key Features
- Hybrid modeling: Custom CNNs + ResNet-50 transfer learning
- 45,000+ augmented images (rotation/flipping/CLAHE)
- Bias mitigation via SMOTE oversampling
- Grad-CAM visualization for explainable diagnoses
- Real-time prediction capability
