Overview
This repository contains a state-of-the-art crop disease detection system capable of analyzing leaf images across 9 critical agricultural species:
Apple, Potato, Cherry, Corn, Grape, Pepper Bell, Sugarcane, Tomato, and Strawberry. The hybrid architecture combines custom CNNs with fine-tuned ResNet-50 models to achieve 95.5% prediction accuracy on real-world field data.

Key Features
🧠 Hybrid Model Architecture: Proprietary CNNs for 7 crops + ResNet-50 transfer learning for complex cases

📊 45K+ Augmented Dataset: Advanced preprocessing with rotation, flipping, and CLAHE histogram equalization

⚖️ Bias Mitigation: SMOTE oversampling and stratified sampling to ensure balanced predictions

🔍 Explainable AI: Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for interpretable diagnoses

🛡️ Robust Inference: Monte Carlo dropout techniques for reliable field deployment
